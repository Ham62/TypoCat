# TypoCat
Typo the cat is here to be your new best friend and to keep you company

### INSTALLING AND USING:
Copy "typocat.exe" into any folder of your choosing and it's ready to go!<br />
Drag Typo wherever you want on the screen and he'll tap along with you as you type on the keyboard.

### COMPILING:
The project is written in [FreeBASIC](http://www.freebasic.net/) so you will need to download and install the compiler before you can build TypoCat.<br />
TypoCat can be compiled with the command:<br />
```fbc -s gui typocat.rc ```
